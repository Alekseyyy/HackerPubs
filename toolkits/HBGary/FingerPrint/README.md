# HBGary FingerPrint

This was a tool developed circa. 2010 to assist DFIR specialists in detecting malware and organising compiled Windows binaries based on their unique characteristics, or their "fingerprints."

Special thanks to _The HBGary Emails_ [1] archived by _Wikileaks_ for the source material that I'm mirroring to this repo!

## FingerPrint Tool & Source Code

* [FingerPrint v1.0](./FingerPrint%20v1.0): the compiled FingerPrint binary, ``FP.exe``, along with the original "FingerPrints" developed by HBGary.
    * Source Code RAR archive: [FingerPrint v1.0.rar.bak](./misc/FingerPrint%20v1.0.rar.bak) - just remove the ``.bak`` extension to open it in Windows Explorer, or you can just ``unrar`` the files ;-)
    * Source [2] (Retrieved on Dec. 5, 2024): https://wikileaks.org/hbgary-emails/emailid/8596

* __FingerPrint (Alpha)__
    * Source Code ZIP Archive: [FingerPrint_Alpha.zip.bak](./misc/Fingerprint_Alpha.zip.bak) - like with the v1.0 stable release, but instead of ``unrar``ing the archive, you'll be ``unzip``ing it ;-)
    * Source [3] (Retrieved on Dec. 5, 2024): https://wikileaks.org/hbgary-emails/emailid/24931 
    
* __FingerPrint (Beta)__
    * Source Code ZIP Archive: [FingerPrint_Beta.zip.bak](./misc/FingerPrint_Beta.zip.bak)
    * Source [4] (Retrieved on Dec. 5, 2024): https://wikileaks.org/hbgary-emails/emailid/18676
    
## FingerPrint Documentation

* Aaron Barr's Blog Post on FingerPrint \([pdf](./misc/Aaron%20Barr%20Fingerprint%20Tool%20Blogpost.pdf), [original docx](./misc/Aaron%20Barr%20Fingerprint%20Tool%20Blogpost.pdf)\): this appears to be a draft of a blog post by an executive from HBGary. I am not sure if this was published onto their website.
