## Introduction

This repository initially started out as "_The Phineas Philes_," which acted as a mirror for the writeups and hacker manifestos published by "Phineas Fisher." However, drawing inspiration from [David Diaz's hacker zine mirror](https://github.com/alfdav/Zines), I decided to "rebrand" this project into a mirror and/or index for publications by different people/organisations in hacking community.

## Publications

### Hack In The Box

[TODO]

### Jonathan Scott (@jonathandata1)

Jonathan Scott is a controversial researcher in the infosec community. While I will mirror some of his works here, I just want to put a disclaimer here stating that this is not meant as an endorsement of his work. Rather, I figured that I would put them here as a reference.

* [Cyfon (Toolkit)](./toolkits/jonathandata1/cyfon): a set of Bash scripts that automate the processes involved in bug bounties and vulnerability disclosure.
    * Special thanks to the webadmin of ``https://blackmarble.sh/`` for their mirror of Scott's Cyfon toolkit (which I ``git clone``'d on Dec. 4, 2024): https://git.blackmarble.sh/backup/cyfon
