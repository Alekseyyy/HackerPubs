# Hacker Publications

## Introduction

This repository initially started out as "_The Phineas Philes_," which acted as a mirror for the writeups and hacker manifestos published by "Phineas Fisher." However, drawing inspiration from [David Diaz's hacker zine mirror](https://github.com/alfdav/Zines), I decided to "rebrand" this project into a mirror and/or index for publications by different hacker individuals or organisations.

## Publications

I segregate publications to two kinds: 

* __Professional:__ publications that are more "professional" and directly linked to the industry.
* __Zine:__ a more amateur hacker publication by an individual or group.
